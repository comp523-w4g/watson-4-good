# Potential Ideas
- aggregate tweets related to #SilentSam -> run tweets through Watson Sentiment analysis -> represent the sentiment using lights or physical visual indicator surrounding statue
- show a physical NC map separated by county. Counties light up based on tweets from people from each county. When a certain threshold is reached(visual indicator reaches an extreme), an email is autogenerated and sent to respective legislator with tweet contents
- Venmo integration: when a certain visual indication is reached via Watson Sentiment, send a venmo link to all who've tweeted to enable crowdsourcing donations (to fund UNC Black Student Movement, poltiical campaigns, etc)
