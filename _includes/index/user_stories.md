## <a name="uses"></a>General User Types
### We anticipate having two types of general users
* **Users who wish to use the platform**
  - users who require only basic functionality, i.e. a simple visual representation of aggregated sentiment around a single given hashtag
  - some other users in this category may want to customize what colors are represented in the sentiment analysis, or run the analysis on multiple hashtags surrounding an issue
  - examples of this user include students and politicians/business owners
* **Users who wish to build upon the platform**
  - users who wish to develop and expand upon our platform. This type of user will probably want access to technical documentation and help guides involving our platform. 
  - this type of user could be charachterized as a 'developer'
 * **Personas** <a name ="Personas"></a>
   - John: I'm covering a story on how students feel about DACA for the Daily Tar Heel. I'll look at W4G's monitor which displays the overall sentiment. I'll include this sentiment, and a photo of the monitor in my story.
   - Mary: I like W4G's idea, but I want to expand upon it and add my own features. I will read the technical documentation to understand how it works, then try to tweak it for my own needs.
