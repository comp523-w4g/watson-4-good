## Users and Use Cases
We anticipate having two types of general users
* **Users who wish to use the platform**
  - users who require only basic functionality, i.e. a simple visual representation of aggregated sentiment around a single given hashtag
  - some other users in this category may want to customize what colors are represented in the sentiment analysis, or run the analysis on multiple hashtags surrounding an issue
* **Users who wish to build upon the platform**
  - users who wish to develop and expand upon our platform. This type of user will probably want access to technical documentation and help guides involving our platform.
