## Basic User Manual
* As our site continues to build and become more complex, features that are not intuitive to use will feature **"mouse-overs"** to explain (ie, having a mouse-over that says "Click to Stop Live Stream" on our cancel stream button".
* We also will add a **FAQ** button on the top nav to clearly lay out the common questions for using the app or how to get the best outcomes.
* Our app is designed to be as simple as possible for our most basic user. We want the interface to be **intuitive and obvious**.
	*  Text on screen provides the necessary visual prompts to make users input hashtags. 
	* Once one hashtag is entered, the text saying to input at least one hashtag is replaced by a button that once clicks starts the live stream. 
	* The replacement with the stream button is a further visual cue that indicates to the user how the app should be operated.
	* After that, all the user has to do is watch as charts and sentiment analysis is automatically generated and dynamically updated.

## Advanced User Manual
* For the user who wants to **develop and take our platform further**
* Directions for pulling and starting our platform locally will be in the README of our project's github
	* This requires a user to be familiar with simple terminal navigation and using git.
