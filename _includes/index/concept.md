# <a name="concept"></a>Project Concept and Introduction
## Art + Activism = Artivism
**This project’s goal is to provide a platform that other students can use for “artivisim” by aggregating social media data on campus/community related issues and providing sentiment-analysis via IBM Watson.**

We were inspired by the 2016 Met Gala dress made by Marchesa and IBM. The dress was decorated with LED lights which lit up with colors reflecting real-time sentiment around the Twitter hashtag #MetGala. Expanding upon this idea, we thought of ways in how aggregating social media data (ie, Tweets) and applying tone-analysis and sentiment rendering to that data could be used on campus. 
Almost immediately we thought of Silent Sam, the confederate statue on UNC’s campus, since students and the community have been actively discussing its presence (and many for its removal). We want our platform to be able to be tailored to any campus issue or topic, from Black Lives Matter to UNC basketball.
