#### We will be using Javascript testing frameworks since our entire app (front-end + back-end) is written in Javascript
### JS Testing Frameworks
* Jest as driver
* Sinon for mock testing (& mocking 3rd party API calls)
* Chai as our assertion library

### Unit

### Automated
* Run canary tests periodically

### Regression
* Make sure updates and new commits don't interfere with existing functionality 

### Testing environments
* Browsers: Chrome, FF, IE, Edge
* Method: Automated tests & freelance testing

### Test cases
* User inputs a single hashtag
  + Sees sentiment for that hashtag
* User inputs multiple hashtags
  + Sees sentiment for all those tags
